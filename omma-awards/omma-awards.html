      <td style="font-size:18px;"><p><strong>Virginia Beach, VA</strong> — October 10, 2013. Studio Center Total Production’s online video, &quot;<strong>Web Guy</strong>&quot;, was a Top Three Finalist out of thousands of entries submitted for competition in the 7th annual International <strong>OMMA AWARDS</strong> presented in New York City.</p>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Web Guy</strong>&quot; won the distinction of making it to the finals in the category of “<strong>Best Email Campaign or Standalone</strong>” and was joined by “HP Envy” by Yesmail Interactive for HP and “Delta Wanderland” by DigitasLBi for Delta Air Lines. “Delta Wanderland” won.</p>
        <p>The awards, which “celebrate the year's most innovative and brilliant online advertising creative, campaigns and web sites across 65 categories within three disciplines”, attract some of the world’s most respected agencies and companies. This year’s participants included Mullen, Havas Worldwide, Spotify, Avatar Labs, Huffington Post Media Group, Arnold Worldwide, Taco Bell, Mercedes, Expedia, Trip Advisor, American Express, Samsung, Disney, Goldman Sachs, HBO, Cinemax, Proctor and Gamble and Bank of America - to name but a few.</p>
        <p>Studio Center CEO, William “Woody” Prettyman, commented, &quot;We <strong>REALLY</strong> wanted to win this one, but there is no shame in losing to Delta Airlines and Digitas. Their video was just tremendous and a deserving winner. It was an honor to make the Final Three. Just wait until next year!&quot;</p>
